              This is a true story. The events depicted took place in <b>Northwind company</b> in{' '}
              <b>1996-1998</b>. At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of
              respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred.

        <code>__generated__</code> folders should be added to <code>.gitignore</code> file.
        It&apos;s bad to keep generated files in repo because it complicates code review. You need
        to generate files everytime before you build or start app in watch mode. In this repo I keep
        generated files only for demo purposes!
